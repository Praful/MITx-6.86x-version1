# MITx-6.86x-version1
Shareable files for the MIT course [Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.86x+1T2020/course/). The course took place from Feb to May 2020.

## Project 4: Collaborative Filtering via Gaussian Mixtures

### 3. Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm

The tests in `test_3_em_algorithm.py` use input and output from my submissions on the course for this section. These are used to check your results. Tests exist for the original toy dataset, the `estep` and the `mstep`.

I could not work out how to create a test for the `run()`. If you have, please let me know and I'll update the code.

Instructions

1. Put all files in the same folder (`netflix`) as `naive_em.py`. 
2. To run
```
python test_3_em_algorithm.py
```

The other files (`*test_input*.py`) contain the input and output test data.
