# MITx-6.86x-version1
Shareable files for the MIT course [Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.86x+1T2020/course/). The course took place from Feb to May 2020.

## Project 4: Collaborative Filtering via Gaussian Mixtures

### 3. Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm

The tests in `test_3_em_algorithm.py` use input and output from my submissions on the course for this section. These are used to check your results. Tests exist for the original toy dataset, and the `estep`, `mstep`, and `run` functions.

I've also added tests for the BIC function, which is in part 5.

I tested and developed these on Windows 10. Obviously, I can't guarantee that these 
will work on your computer.


If you don't want to run a particular test, you can either comment out the whole test 
or add the following above the function definition:
```
@unittest.skip('Skip this test')
```
### 7. Implementing EM for matrix completion

The tests in `test_7_em_matrix_completion.py` use input and output from my submissions on the course for this section for `estep` and `mstep`.

Also included are tests from the `test_solutions.txt` to create tests for `estep`, `mstep` and `run`. 

### Instructions

Files are shared between different parts. For convenience, I've put all the files in the same original git folder (`part3`) I created for the first tests.

1. Put all files in the same folder (`netflix`) as `naive_em.py` and `em.py`
2. To run the tests for each section, enter in a console:

```
python test_3_em_algorithm.py
python test_7_em_matrix_completion.py
```

The other files (`*test_input*.py`) contain the input and output test data. 

## Project 5: Text-based game
### 3. Q-learning algorithm
The tests in `test.py` use input from `q_func.npy` (a previously saved `q_func` array) to test functions `tabular_q_learning()` and `epsilon_greedy()` in `agent_tabular_ql.py`. 

Save the files in the same folder as `agent_tabular_ql.py` and run:
```
python test.py
```
